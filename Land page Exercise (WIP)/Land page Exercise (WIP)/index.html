                        <p>Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Meltzer, Fran Bilas, and Ruth Lichterman. Originally hired as ‘human computers’ to hand calculate thousands of equations, they were later selected to operate the ENIAC because they were the most mathematically advanced in their group. </p>
                        <p>This was during a time when women were hired to do computing work- a task that was considered ‘too clerical’ for the male engineers. So, this promotion was pretty revolutionary. The women were now ‘machine operators’- controlling the electronic circuit of the computer which contained tens of thousands of switches, wires and digit trays. </p>
                        Now, learning to operate this machine was no easy task. While they were provided with the blueprints to familiarize themselves with the machine’s workings, it took them six months to fully learn to operate it. During this time, they had to ‘debug’ any faults, crawl into the machine to fix any vacuum tubes that had burned out, and take copious, detailed notes on what they fixed.
                        <p><strong>Jennings recalls the time when she joined the team:</strong> </p>
                        <h4>“I had no idea what the job was or what the ENIAC was. All I knew was that I might be getting in on the ground floor of something new, and I believed I could learn and do anything as well as anyone else.”</h4>

                        <h2>What was the ENIAC?</h2>
                        <h4>ENIAC, in full Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital computer, built during World War II by the United States. American physicist John Mauchly, American engineer J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and their colleagues at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania led a government-funded project to build an all-electronic computer. Under contract to the army and under the direction of Herman Goldstine, work began in early 1943 on ENIAC. The next year, mathematician John von Neumann began frequent consultations with the group.
                            ENIAC was something less than the dream of a universal computer. Designed specifically for computing values for artillery range tables, it lacked some features that would have made it a more generally useful machine. It used plugboards for communicating instructions to the machine; this had the advantage that, once the instructions were thus “programmed,” the machine ran at electronic speed. Instructions read from a card reader or other slow mechanical device would not have been able to keep up with the all-electronic ENIAC. The disadvantage was that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem. This was such a liability that only with some generosity could it be called programmable.</h4>
